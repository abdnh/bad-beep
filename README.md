The [Bad Apple!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtutLA63Cp8) song played using the [beep](https://linux.die.net/man/1/beep) command.

This is a Bash script that contains the beep commands required to play the song. To run:

```
./bad-beep
```

The script is generated by the [generate-from-notes.py](generate-from-notes.py) Python script.

I'm not exactly sure how good this sounds. I don't have a good ear for music, and this could be literally just bad beeps :)

## TODO

- [ ] extract frequencies from the audio file itself
- [ ] actually render the song's animation on the terminal!
